Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

ðŸ”­ I build and manage scalable data pipelines across Snowflake, AWS, Redshift, and SAP HANA to support both e-commerce and retail analytics.

ðŸ§° I develop automation tools and backend systems in Python to streamline operations, run scheduled workflows, and maintain data integrity.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and refining my skills in Big Data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and security best practices.

ðŸ‘¯ Always open to collaborating on projects that enhance performance, reduce manual work, and deliver value at scale.

âš¡ Fun fact: My brand was inspired by fitness, recovery, and family â€” and now it's helping others build their own health journey, one supplement at a time.
